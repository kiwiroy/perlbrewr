```

## Installed perls

```{r}
perlbrew_list(root = params$perlbrew_root, include.libs = FALSE)
```


## Some perl code

Perl code can now be written that uses the specific interpreter with version
``r params$perl_version`` as part of the perlbrew installation in
``r params$perlbrew_root``.

```{r perl-test, engine = "perl"}
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature 'say';
say "Hello World";
say "perl is: $^X";
```


## Using a library for analysis

A [`local::lib`](https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib) is easily created to
allow for user level installation and enhance reproducibility of a workflow
by using a [`cpanfile`](https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanfile) to install
dependencies with [`cpanm`](https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm).

```{r perl-library}
success <- perlbrew_lib_create(root = params$perlbrew_root,
                               version = params$perl_version,
                               lib = "template",
                               perlbrew.use = TRUE)
available <- perlbrew_list(root = params$perlbrew_root)
attr(available, "active")
```

Knitr has already been updated to use the `PERL5LIB` by setting `engine.opts`.

* ``r knitr::opts_chunk$get("engine.opts")$perl``

Chunks interpreted with Bash will also have the correct environment to do what
I mean (DWIM).
```{r command-line, engine = "bash"}
which perl
which cpanm
echo $PERL5LIB
```

In this way any perl scripts that have dependencies, may have these
dependencies met by using `cpanm` to install the modules from
[CPAN](https://metacpan.org) using the `cpanfile` that was included with the
script :tada:.
